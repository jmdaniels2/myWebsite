            <em><b>James Daniels</b></em><br>
            Grandson of a performing classical pianist, grew up at the base of a piano. 
            With a father who was heavily into jazz and bebop, James was privileged almost 
            entirely Jazz and Blues as a child. Growing up playing trumpet, James left high school 
            early for college and worked with the Edison Big Band in SW Florida.  
            It was during this time that jazz guitar became an integral part of understanding harmony 
            and would become a primary instrument. Studying guitar with Jeff Ladenheim 
            in Gainesville, Florida and gigging in 
            many bands throughout the S.E. on mandolin in blues and bluegrass prepared James 
            for what would eventually become a full time role of Guitar performance at North Carolina
            Central University. During this time, James has studied under Joey Caldorazo, Branford Marsalis,
            Baron Tymas, Ira Wiggins, taken master classes with the likes of Nate Smith, Bob Moses,
            Charlie Hunter, Al Strong, Jonathan Scales and many composers from the NYC jazz scene. James
            currently resides in Durham, NC and regularly performs on the music scene throughout
            the triangle with various artists in his own Trio, and Sam King Duo.
